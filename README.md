# QueueUnderflow
This is a repository containing my assignment for the Software Design laboratory from my university curriculum. The aim of this assignment is to develop a StackOverflow like platform, where users can post questions which can be answered by other users. The project is a web application, so it's composed out of a database, a backend and a frontend.

## Database
The database is written in MySQL, and this repository contains a file ```QueueUnderflowDatabase.sql``` which is a SQL Script containing the database used for testing.

## Backend
The backend is written in Java using the Spring Framework, and it follows the layered architecture pattern.

## Frontend
TO DO

## Setting up the project
TO DO when the project is finished
